This java file implements the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path (distance)
between one state to the rest of states. First, the two dimensional array is initialized
and the values are set to infinity. The array contains the previous state and the current
state. All the states are initially set to unvisited and the distance is updated when the 
state gets visited. The algorithm also updates the distance if it finds an alternative
shortest path.
